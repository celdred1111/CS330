How do I approach designing software?
  What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
  What design process did you follow for your project work?
  How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
  
I approach software in a very peice by peice way.
This project helped me get better at breaking things into logical bits and then using that to build a whole.
I used the 7 design steps concept of define the problem, research, conceptualize, prototype, adjust, assess, finalize 
This is a thorough design process that suits my thinking so I will use this tactic exactly again. 

How do I approach developing programs?
  What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
  How did iteration factor into your development?
  How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
  
I approach it in the same way
I broke things down better into bits i could manage more easily
The iteration could not have been done without this and vise versa
The milestones helped be get better at understanding how and where to break bits into peices

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
  How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
  
computer science will help me a lot as a programer as it is the science that underlies it. 
As this is my last class, it will not.
Most of the skills gained in this class are very transferable to other types of programming (where i will most likely work)
